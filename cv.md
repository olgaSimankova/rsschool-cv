## About me:

I used to work as a stock photographer for the last 4 years but this work became too monotonous for me, there was nothing new to learn. So I got back to square one and analyzed what I've been interested in at school and University. I highly appreciate activities where I can develop during my life. That's how I began studying programming. It seems to me as an exiting and creative way to solve analytical problems.
I wish to be a full-stack JavaScript developer, but currently I'm discovering frontend first.
